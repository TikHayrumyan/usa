        Creator Deck is not directed to children, and we expect that any use by children will only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials. Creator Deck relies on parents and guardians to ensure that minors only use Creator Deck if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as laid out in these Terms of Service and in our Privacy Policy.In the event that you are a school, district or teacher in the United States and want your students, who are under the age of 13, to create Creator Deck accounts - including in conjunction with the establishment of a Creator Deck Business account - you agree that you are responsible for complying with the U.S. Children&lsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (&ldquo;COPPA&ldquo;) and, to the extent applicable, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (&ldquo;FERPA&ldquo;). This means that you must notify the students&lsquo; parents/guardians of the personally identifiable information that Creator Deck will collect, and that you will obtain parental/guardian consent before your students establish accounts or use Creator Deck. When obtaining such consent, you must provide parents/guardians with a copy of our Privacy Policy. You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission&lsquo;s website. If you are located outside of the United States, we will rely upon you to obtain any required consent or approval from the parent or guardian of any student covered by similar laws, and, as a condition to your and your students&lsquo; use of Creator Deck, you agree that you will be responsible for complying with such laws.

        Credit cards are the only payment mechanism Creator Deck will accept for payment of a monthly or yearly subscription fee (&ldquo;Subscription Fee&ldquo;) for a Paid Plan.

        If you select a Paid Plan, You must provide current, complete and accurate Billing Data. You must promptly update all Billing Data to keep Your Account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number or credit card expiration date) and You must promptly notify Creator Deck if Your Payment Method is changed (for example, for loss or theft) or if You become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of Your name or password.

If You select the Yearly Fee, the credit card that You provide as part of the Billing Data will be automatically and immediately billed on the day You sign up.

Creator Deck may change prices at any time without prior notice, but will endeavor to provide reasonable advance notice via the Creator Deck website and/or electronic mail.
